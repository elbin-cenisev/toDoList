# toDoList
Assignment 5 of the Full Flex Coding Bootcamp
Author: Elbin Cenisev

## Description
Given a HTML template to start with, we were instructed to create a to do list / day planner that users could use to schedule tasks for each hour of the day.
Using moment.js, the web app then checks the user's local time of day and color codes the planner based on items being over due, present or in the future.
Each task must be saved in local storage so that users can return to web page and still see their tasks.
